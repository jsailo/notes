Let's start with the usual. 

I'm a Technical Writer based in Delhi with over 17 years of writing technical documentation in the IT industry. Over this perod I have written documentation for products whose domains range from Telecom, RPA, ATM/POS transactions management, ERP, CRM, enterprise mobile applications, guest facing technologies, and embedded systems. Blue chip companies I have written documentation for include, HP, Microsoft, and NCR Teradata.

In my free time, I dabble with photography and watch documentaries. I also read - when time permits.

As for my background, I'm a [Mizo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizo_people) but have lived all my life in Delhi.
