# Installing Rebased

## Buying a VPS

You need to host your website (instance or server) somewhere, so you need to buy a VPS. Rebased does not support shared hosting, so you'll need to go for a VPS. Some of the VPS providers I recommend are  DigitalOcean or Linode. 

## Buying a domain

Buy a domain. I personally prefer Namecheap.
