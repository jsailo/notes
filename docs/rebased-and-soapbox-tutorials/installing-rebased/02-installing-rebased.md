Now that you have a VPS and domain name ready, let's begin with installing Rebased first.

1. Run the following commands to update and ugrade your fresh Ubuntu machine.

    ```bash
    apt update -y
    apt upgrade -y
    ```
    :::note
    The `y` flag is similar to your Windows `Yes to all` button.
    :::

2. Install the system dependencies. These are needed for your Rebased installation to function properly.
    ```bash
    apt install git curl build-essential postgresql postgresql-contrib cmake libmagic-dev imagemagick ffmpeg libimage-exiftool-perl nginx certbot unzip libssl-dev automake autoconf libncurses5-dev fasttext
    ```
    A brief description of some of these dependencies.
    - postgresql: The free and open-source PostgreSQL database
    - imagemagick: Pronounced 'Image Magick', this tool converts and optimizes images uploaded to your website, like resize overtly large images (image scaling) or convert them into another format.
    - ffmpeg: Optimizes videos uploaded to your website, such as resizing (file size) or converting uploaded videos to another format so they are served in a format that's best for visitors of your website.
    - nginx: This is a configuration file that allows you to control the nitty gritties of your server. 
    - certbot: This allows you to fetch certificates from certbot. The `https` you see on websites is because of this.
    - unzip: A utility for unzipping files on your server. Take it as, 'the Winzip of Linux'.

3. Create the Pleroma user. Here, you are creating a new user called `Pleroma` in the Ubuntu machine. This is the user with which you will interact with your Rebased installation.
    ```bash
    useradd -r -s /bin/false -m -d /var/lib/pleroma -U pleroma
    ```

4. Download the Rebased source code.
    ```bash
    git clone -b develop https://gitlab.com/soapbox-pub/rebased /opt/pleroma
    ```

5. Change ownership to the Pleroma user.
    ```bash
    chown -R pleroma:pleroma /opt/pleroma
    ```

6. Enter the source code directory and make yourself the Pleroma user.
    ```bash
    cd /opt/pleroma
    sudo -Hu pleroma bash
    ```

7. Rebased uses the Elixir programming language (based on Erlang). It‚Äôs important we use a specific version of Erlang (24), so we‚Äôll use the `asdf` version manager to install it. Yes, that's `asdf`.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.10.0
    echo ". $HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
    echo ". $HOME/.asdf/completions/asdf.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
    exec bash
    asdf plugin-add erlang
    asdf plugin-add elixir
    ```

8. Almost there. Install Erlang/Elixir.
    ```bash
    asdf install 
    ```

9. Compile Rebased.
    ```bash
    mix local.hex --force
    mix local.rebar --force
    ```

10. Fetch Elixir dependencies.
    ```bash
    mix deps.get
    ```

11. Finally, compile Soapbox.
    ```bash
    MIX_ENV=prod mix compile
    ```
    :::tip
        This will take a good 10 minutes üïô. Go grab and make a Maggi or some noodles üçú
    :::

12. Generate the configuration. 
    ```bash 
    MIX_ENV=prod mix pleroma.instance gen
    ```

13. Rename the generated `generated_config.exs` file to `prod.secret.exs` so it gets loaded at runtime
    ```bash 
    mv config/generated_config.exs config/prod.secret.exs
    ```

14. Provision the database. The previous section also created a file called `config/setup_db.psql`, which you can use to create the database. Now exit and get back to being the root user (for the remainder of this document). 
    ```bash 
    exit
    ```

15. Execute the SQL file as the postgres user:
    ```bash 
    sudo -Hu postgres psql -f config/setup_db.psql
    ```

16. Now run the database migration as the pleroma user:
    ```bash 
    sudo -Hu pleroma bash -i -c 'MIX_ENV=prod mix ecto.migrate'
    ```

17. Copy the generated `pleroma.service` file to the `systemd` directory.
    ```bash 
    cp /opt/pleroma/installation/pleroma.service /etc/systemd/system/pleroma.service
    ```

18. Enable the Pleroma service.
    ```bash 
    systemctl enable --now pleroma.service
    ```
