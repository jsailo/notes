title: About Rebased and Soapbox
---

Rebased and Soapbox are software that allow you to start your own decentralized social media website, which is connected to the Fediverse. The Fediverse is a network of websites where users from each website can talk to each other using the ActivityPub protocol. You can run Soapbox for yourself (single-user instance/website) or invite your friends and family to join. As with other Fediverse software, privacy is the core philosophy of Rebased and Soapbox.

Rebased is the backend and is a fork of Pleroma developed using Erlang (Elixir). Soapbox on the other hand is the frontend with which you interact with other users in the Fediverse. It is developed using Typescript.
