title: About Rebased and Soapbox
---

Rebased and Soapbox are software that allow you to start your own decentralized social media website that connects you to the Fediverse. You can run it for yourself (single-user instance) or invite your friends and family to join. As with other Fediverse software, privacy is the core philosophy of Rebased and Soapbox.

Rebased is a fork of Pleroma and is developed using Erlang (Elixir). Soapbox on the other hand is the frontend with which you'll interact with other users in the Fediverse. It is developed using Typescript.
