The first step of installing Rebased and Soapbox is choosing a VPS to host your instance/server (website) and a domain name.

## Choosing a VPS

You need to host your website somewhere, so you need to buy a VPS from a cloud service provider. Since Rebased does not support shared hosting, you'll need to purchase a VPS. I've had years of using DigitalOcean's droplets and their services, so I personally recommend it.

## Buying a domain

Buy a domain name. I personally prefer [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com/).
