title: Choosing a VPS and domain name

The first step of installing Rebased and Soapbox is choosing a VPS to host your instance/server (website) and a domain name.

## Choosing a VPS

You need to host your website somewhere, so you must buy a VPS from a cloud service provider. 

### Why a VPS?

Rebased cannot be hosted on a shared hosting platform so you'll need to purchase a VPS because of the background services and configurations required to run Rebased and Soapbox. I've used DigitalOcean's droplets and their services for years, so I personally recommend them.

## Buying a domain

Buy a domain name. I personally prefer [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com/).
