title: Choosing a VPS and domain name

The first step of installing Rebased and Soapbox is choosing a VPS to host your instance/server (website) and a domain name.

## Choosing a VPS

You need to host your website somewhere, so you need to buy a VPS. Since Rebased does not support shared hosting, you'll need to purchase a VPS. Some of the VPS providers I recommend are  DigitalOcean or Linode. 

## Buying a domain

Buy a domain name. I personally prefer Namecheap.
