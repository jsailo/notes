The first step of installing Rebased and Soapbox is choosing a VPS to host your website and a domain name.

## Choosing a VPS

You need to host your website (instance or server) somewhere, so you need to buy a VPS. Since Rebased does not support shared hosting, you'll need to go for and purchase a VPS. Some of the VPS providers I recommend are  DigitalOcean or Linode. 

## Buying a domain

Buy a domain. I personally prefer Namecheap.
